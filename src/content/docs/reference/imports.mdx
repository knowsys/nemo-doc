Import directives are used to import external data resources as predicates.

## Syntax
The general syntax of an import statement is as follows:
```
@import <predicate> :- <format>{<parameter>=<value>, ...} .
```
In the example below `table` denotes the predicate that data is imported to, `csv` is the data format (comma-separated values),
and `path/to/file.csv` is the relative path to the file. Instead of a local path, it is also possible to define a URL from
which data should be downloaded, e.g., `resource = "https://example.org/file.csv"`.

```
@import table :- csv { resource="path/to/file.csv", format=(int,string, any)}.
```


## Formats

Currently the following formats are supported:

<DisplayFormats formats={formats} direction="import" />



### Format specific notes
- `nquads`, `trig`: data is always imported in order "graphname, subject, predicate, object"
- `ntriples`, `rdfxml`, `turtle`: data is always imported in order "subject, predicate, object"
- `sparql`: can be used to make a `query` following the [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) syntax to a specific `endpoint`.  For example, the import statement below will retrieve the number of humans that are known to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page):
    ```
    @import nr_humans :- sparql{endpoint = <https://query.wikidata.org/sparql>, query="""
        PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>
        PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>
        SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?count)
        WHERE {
        ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .
        }"""
    } .
    ```
- `json`: data is deserialized into a table representation consisting of triples of the form "object-id, key, object-id"
 (see table below, how each json type is represented).   
 The root object of the document always has object-id 0. Furthermore, for each object-id a triple of the form "object-id, `<type>`, type-id" is stored, where type-id is one of `"object"`, `"array"`, `"string"`, `"number"`, `"bool"` or `"null"`. Literal values will be assigned an object-id as well, with a triple of the form "object-id, `<value>`, literal-value"

```

### Available parameters

<DisplayParameters formats={formats} direction="import" />

#### The `format` parameter

Some import formats, such as `csv`, do not specify how values in the file should be interpreted. By default, Nemo will heuristically interpret data.
For example, in CSV files, the string `123` will be interpreted as an integer, but the string `abc` as a constant name (relative IRI). 
To control this in more detail, the parameter `format` can be used. It takes a list of format strings, like in the following example:

```
@import data :- csv{resource="file.csv", format=(string,string,int,any)} .
```

This example imports from a CSV file that should have four columns: the first two will be read as literal strings, the third as an integer, and the final as "anything" that seems right (the default format, also good for IRIs). Lines that cannot be interpreted in this format will be skipped silently, e.g., if a line has something in the third field that does not look like an integer. Therefore, all imported data is guaranteed to have the chosen format. Currently, Nemo supports the following formats:

- `any`: the default best-effort parsing
- `string`: try to interpret all values as plain strings, fastest import option for CSV
- `int`: interpret values as integers, if possible
- `double`: interpret values as double precision floats (f64), if possible
- `skip`: special format to ignore a column entirely (if used, the imported data has smaller arity than the table in the file)

The same formats can be used in RDF imports as well. RDF has a more precise type system, where every value has an unambiguous type. The formats then mainly act as filters that will remove triples that do not fit (e.g., to load only triples with integer values). For converting values to other datatypes, e.g., from integers to strings, rules with built-in functions (in this case `STR`) can be used after import.

## Fstrings
Fstrings are supported in the import statement as can be seen in the example below:
```
@import table :- csv{resource = f"file-{?x}-{?y}.csv"}, ?x = "name", ?y = 42 .
```
