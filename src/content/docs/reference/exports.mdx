import FormatTable from '../../../components/format_table.astro';

Export directives are used to write computation results to files.

## Syntax
The syntax of an export directive is as follows:
```
@export <predicate> :- <format>{<parameter>=<value>, ...} .
```

For example, the following export writes a CSV file that contains two columns, with the first formatted as plain string and the second as an integer. The third parameter of the exported predicate `result` is skipped and will not be in the file:

```
@export result :- csv{resource="out.csv.gz", format=(string,int,skip)} .
```

The output will be gzipped (guessed from file name). Tuples that contain anything other than a string in the first component and an integer in the second will not be exported and ignored silently.

## Formats

Currently the following formats are supported:

<FormatTable direction="export" formats={formats} />

### Available parameters

<Tabs>
  {Object.entries(formats).map(([key, format]) => (
    <TabItem label={format.name}>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <FormatLayout of={key} class="my-4" />
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </TabItem>
  ))}

</Tabs>

When using the [Nemo command-line client](/nemo-doc/guides/cli), some cli options are available to override the export directives in the program, to set the output (base) directory, and to control if existing files should be overwritten.

The parameters in export directives can also make use of format strings, e.g.,
```
@export table :- csv{resource = f"file-{?x}-{?y}.csv"}, ?x = "name", ?y = 42 .
```
