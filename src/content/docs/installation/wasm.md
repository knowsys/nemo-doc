title: Web-Browser Integration
---



[Nemo](/nemo-doc/intro/welcome/) can be compiled into a [Web assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) library that can be used in browser-based applications. In this mode, rule reasoning is run completely in the browser, without any need to install software or transmit data to remote servers.

You can see and test an example of such an application at our [online demo](/nemo-doc/installation/browser/). The source code of this website is available at https://github.com/knowsys/nemo-web .
